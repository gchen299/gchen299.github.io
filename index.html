    <p> Hello! I'm Gilbert and I am a Freshman majoring in Computer Science at the University at 
    Buffalo. I decided to major in computer science because I believed it would
    be fun, however I might find an interest for another major in the future. I 
    don't exactly have a goal for myself in the future. I don't know what my 
    "dream job" will be, but I hope it'll be a job that I'll love very much. 
    Confucius once said, "Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work
    a day in your life." </p>
